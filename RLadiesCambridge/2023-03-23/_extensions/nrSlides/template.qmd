## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation.
To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
```

You can also add `text marked as code`! 

# New topic! {background-color="#2F4F4F"}

To make a slide like this, use:

    # Section title {background-color="#2F4F4F"}
