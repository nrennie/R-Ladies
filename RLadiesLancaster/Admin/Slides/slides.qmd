## What is R-Ladies?

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}

R-Ladies is a worldwide organisation whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community.

The R community suffers from an under-representation of minority genders in every role and area of participation.

The primary focus is on supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network.

## Code of Conduct

R-Ladies has a code of conduct all attendees are expected to follow: [rladies.org/coc](https://rladies.org/coc/). This code of conduct applies to all R-Ladies spaces, including meetups, Twitter, Slack, mailing lists, both online and offline. 

R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

R-Ladies prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort.
