[A bar chart titled Lemurs at Duke Lemur Center.]{.fragment} [On the x-axis three species of lemurs are shown including the Crowned lemur, Gray mouse lemur, and Ring-tailed lemur. On the y-axis the count of the number of each species is shown.]{.fragment} [The number of lemurs ranges from just under 2500 for Crowned lemurs, to almost 12500 for Gray mouse lemurs.]{.fragment} [The number of Crowned lemurs is significantly lower than the other two species shown.]{.fragment}

## Writing alt text in {ggplot2}

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "7"
g <- ggplot(lemurs, aes(x = name, y = n, fill = name)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "Number of lemurs",
       title = "Lemurs at Duke Lemur Center", 
       alt = "A bar chart titled Lemurs at Duke Lemur Center. On the x-axis three species of lemurs are shown including the Crowned lemur, Gray mouse lemur, and Ring-tailed lemur. On the y-axis the count of the number of each species is shown. The number of lemurs ranges from just under 2500 for Crowned lemurs, to almost 12500 for Gray mouse lemurs. The number of Crowned lemurs is significantly lower than the other two species shown.")

## Automatically generating alt text

<br>

{{< fa solid face-frown >}} Never as good as alt text written by a human

{{< fa solid face-frown >}} Often misses the "what's the point?" element of the plot

{{< fa solid face-meh >}} Potentially useful in interactive graphics if carefully considered

## Automatically generating alt text

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
library(BrailleR)
VI(g)
```

## Automatically generating alt text

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
